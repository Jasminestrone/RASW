```

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

After installation, you can use the `rasw-cli` command:

```bash
# Get help
rasw-cli --help

# Show version
rasw-cli --version

# Forward Kinematics
rasw-cli fk --lengths 160 160 160 --angles 45 -30 60

# Inverse Kinematics 
rasw-cli ik --position 200 150 --lengths 160 160
```

### Python Library

You can also use RASW directly in your Python code:

```python
from RASW import calculate_fk, calculate_ik

# Forward Kinematics example
arm_lengths = [160, 160, 160]  # Three arm segments
joint_angles = [45, -30, 60]   # Joint angles in degrees
joint_positions, error = calculate_fk(arm_lengths, joint_angles)

if not error:
    base_pos = joint_positions[0]
    end_effector_pos = joint_positions[-1]
    print(f"End effector at: ({end_effector_pos[0]:.2f}, {end_effector_pos[1]:.2f})")

# Inverse Kinematics example
target_x, target_y = 200, 150
arm_lengths = [160, 160]  # Two arm segments
joint_angles, error = calculate_ik(target_x, target_y, arm_lengths)

if not error:
    shoulder_angle = joint_angles[0]
    elbow_angle = joint_angles[1]
    print(f"Shoulder angle: {shoulder_angle:.2f}°, Elbow angle: {elbow_angle:.2f}°")
```

<h3>Math for 2D inverse kinematics</h3>

The elbow angle is found using the law of cosines where we do
    $$\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{L_1^2 + L_2^2 - D^2}{2L_1L_2}$$
Then we can find the elbow angle using the equation
    $$\theta_2 = \cos^{-1}(\cos(\theta_2))$$
This outputs the angle that the elbow arm needs to be at (where 0 degrees is fully extended and 180 degrees is fully folded back)

Next we compute the shoulder angle in two steps:
1. First we find the angle from the origin to the target point:
   $$\alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$$
2. Then we find the angle between the first link and the line to the target:
   $$\cos(\alpha) = \frac{L_1^2 + D^2 - L_2^2}{2L_1D}$$
   $$\beta = \cos^{-1}(\cos(\beta))$$

Finally we get theta1 by subtracting alpha from the target angle:
    $$\theta_1 = \alpha - \beta$$

We convert these angles from radians to degrees by doing:
    $$\theta_1^{\circ} = \theta_1 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}$$ and $$\theta_2^{\circ} = \theta_2 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}$$

<h3>Math for 2D forward kinematics</h3>

The forward kinematics calculation starts with the initial arm segments at the origin pointing along the x-axis, then applies sequential rotations to find each joint position.

For each arm segment (L1, L2, L3, L4), we:
- Begin with a vector along the x-axis with magnitude equal to the link length:
  $$\{arm_vector} = [L_i, 0]$$

- Apply rotation matrices to transform each link vector:
$$
R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
For each joint, the rotation angle is cumulative from previous joints:
- First joint rotates by $\theta_1$ = l1_angle
- Second joint rotates by $\theta_2$ = l1_angle + l2_angle
- Third joint rotates by $\theta_3$ = l1_angle + l2_angle + l3_angle
- Fourth joint rotates by $\theta_4$ = l1_angle + l2_angle + l3_angle + l4_angle

Each joint position is calculated by adding the rotated vector to the previous joint:
  $${joint_i_pos} = {joint_(i-1)_pos} + R(\theta_{\text{cum}}) \cdot {arm_i_vect}$$

This process is repeated sequentially until we reach the end effector position, which is the position after the last arm segment.

The rotation function `rotate_vector(vector, angle)` multiplies the vector by the rotation matrix to produce a new vector rotated by the specified angle:
  $${rotated_vector} = R(\theta) \cdot \text{vector}$$

This approach correctly implements forward kinematics for a 4-link planar arm by accumulating rotations and positions from the base to the end effector.
